# Movies and the Academy Awards
 
 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to communicate some of findings from the data exploration project by presenting interactive narrative visualisation in regard to movies that won the Academy Awards (Oscars) from 1930 to 2014. 


### Version
28 June 2020


### Scope
The scope of this project was the movies that won the Academy Awards from 1930 to 2014, and the Academy Awards were limited to “Best Director”, “Best Actor”, “Best Actress”, “Best Supporting Actor”, and “Best Supporting Actress”. 


### Design & Implementation
Visualisation designs were developed using the Five design Sheet (FdS) methodology, each sheet having five parts. The narrative visualisation was then implemented with D3.js (version 4), which is one of JavaScript libraries, along with JavaScript (ECMAScript 6). The main reason for selecting this library is that it has
great graphing capabilities, using HTML, SVG, and CSS to make webpages interact with data.
